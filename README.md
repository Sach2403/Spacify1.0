# Spacify

Spacify is an innovative app designed to revolutionize the way universities manage study spaces. Spacify employs sensors to capture real-time occupancy data. This data is used to alert students about available study spaces, saving them time. Data is then analyzed by the application to incentivize students who follow occupancy rules, promoting fair usage of study areas.

Spacify stands out from other systems in several ways. Few of them are listed below:
1. Offers a unified reservation system accessible to all students, unlike siloed solutions, currently present in the university. 
2. Real-time tracking feature allows us to know if the reservation was followed & if the expected number of people showed up. This ensures that study spaces are used efficiently. 
3. Incentivization system rewards users for following good behavior. The credits earned can be redeemed within the university. 
4. Displays popular times for each room. This helps students to plan their study sessions better.
   
Overall, Spacify provides a comprehensive & user-friendly study space management system, enhancing the university experience.
